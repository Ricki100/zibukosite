<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;font-style: normal;text-align: center;">We are a community of faith that lives to tell the world how awesome God is!</h3></br>

<p>The Bible tells us, “He who winneth souls is wise.” (Proverbs 11:30). I don’t know about you, but I want to be a wise woman who wins souls for the Lord in these last days. And something tells me that you do too!!! With that being said, here are some practical ways of how you can win souls to Christ :</p></br>
<ul>
<li>Pray and ask God to give you a boldness and courage like never before!</li>

<li>Brush up on your evangelism skills by reading some articles online or by purchasing a book on witnessing and sharing your faith </li>

<li>Buy some gospel tracts and share them with those God places in your path while you’re out and about</li>

<li>Start up a natural conversation and then wait on an open door to share Christ. </li>

<li>Post a Scripture on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter (before you know it, your friends may be inboxing you for advice or prayer)</li>
</ul></br>

<p>The key is sharing your faith. Don’t be afraid. Heaven is at stake. Individual’s lives and purposes are at stake. Healing and deliverance are theirs to grasp. And you play a vital role in helping them receive what they need…which is a life with Jesus (forever).

One of the greatest joys that we can have as Christians is the joy of leading someone to Christ. Think of it! You and I can be God's instruments in the salvation of others.

Who can have the privilege of leading people to Christ? Any believer!</p></br> 

<p>This is not the work of just a few select people. Every Christian is called upon to witness for Christ, and every Christian can be a soul-winner. The Lord Jesus said,


To His disciples, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" (Matthew 4:19). The implication is that if we are really following, we'll be fishing – soul-winning. Jesus' last words were, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations" (Matthew 28:19). The Christians in the New Testament went everywhere, preaching the Word (Acts 8:4).

How, then, can you and I be effective witnesses for Him?</p></br>


<ol>
<li>Ask God to give you an evangelistic burden for others. Ask Him to help you see the world as He sees it, and to lay upon your heart a handful of people for whom you can earnestly pray. Then pray over those names every day. Keep a little prayer list, and pray for an opportunity of reaching these souls for Christ. An old song says, "Lord, lay some soul upon my heart and love that soul through me; / And may I humbly do my part to win that soul to Thee."</li>

<li>Live a consistent Christian life before these people. Jesus said, "You are the light of the world. . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:14-16). We must live obedient lives of integrity and authentic faith. We must love when others hate, and forgive when others harbor grudges. We must remain trusting when others panic, and be honest when all around us are cooking the books. Not that we're going to be perfect – only Christ was sinless. But we must have a growing, maturing Christian life that others recognize and respect.</li>

<li>Build bridges to others. When the Lord shows you those needing Christ, seek to build a relationship with them. Remember how Jesus went to the home of Zacchaeus where many sinners had gathered? While we must be careful not to place ourselves in an environment where we'll be pulled down, we must be equally careful to cultivate friendships with those needing Christ. Perhaps Christ has placed you in your particular school or workplace just to reach those whom no one else can reach.</li>

<li>Learn the Gospel. Memorize the following verses and practice saying them in a mirror or to another Christian until you're comfortable sharing them with someone needing Christ: Romans 3:23; 6:23; 5:8; 10:9, 10, 13; 1 John 5:1, 13.</li>

<li>Watch for openings to share a word for Christ. Peter said: "Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you" (1 Peter 3:15).</li>

<li>If the right opportunity doesn't come naturally, create one. Sometimes we wait too long, looking for just the right time to invite someone to church or to share with them the message of the Gospel. There often comes a point when we must prayerfully introduce the subject and do our best to impress someone with their need for Christ.</li>

<li>Leave the results with God. We're responsible for sharing the Gospel, but only God can convert the soul.Having done your best let him do the rest. </li>
</ol></br>

<p>Jesus is coming back soon, and we have a role to play in advancing the Kingdom before He comes. People all around you need Jesus. Many in your community or even in your circle of family and friends (even on social media) are hurting, broken, desperate, lonely, without hope, don’t know their purpose, and feel like God doesn’t care about them….and you have the answer. So what are you doing to help them?</p></br>

<p>Jesus has called each and every one of us as Christians to be a part of fulfilling the Great Commission. He has called us to share the Good News with the world and to help others mature in Him. This is what Jesus said before ascending into heaven after His death through Matthew 28:19, “Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.” (NLT)He is commissioning you and me to “go and make disciples.” Once we have accepted Christ, and begun the journey of spiritual maturity, then it’s time to help others come to know and live for the Lord. It’s time to advance the Kingdom of heaven. We are called to be the hands and feet of Jesus Christ. We are commissioned to be ambassadors for Jesus.</p></br> 


The most important thing is to know Jesus for yourself, not religion, not your mom's Jesus or your granny's Jesus 
but YOUR JESUS. We need Him. The firm foundation, the revelation rock  is knowing Jesus for who he is, that is the only thing that won't be shaken. This is what gives us the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven. 


<strong>SPEAK THE NAME ABOVE ALL OTHER NAMES
THE NAME OF JESUS..... </strong>

Start  sharing Christ Today!

<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;font-style: normal;text-align: center;">Wendy Matsika </h3></br>

<p>What happened to you, you changed so much? That's the question I get almost every day since I started my journey with Christ or did your social media account get hacked?
Jesus touched me & he changed my life . </p></br>
<p>Sometime last year  a friend of mine Ellar had a dream and I  was in the dream. She heard a revelation from a man who said he was Jesus, she told me about the dream I told her I was going to pray about it so the Lord can give me answers. As I was sleeping I dreamt being asked to wake up and pray at 3am when I tried waking up I could not move then I looked on my bedside there was man sitting and I looked at him and I said Lord, please forgive me for I have sinned. He answered I have already forgiven you.
     The following day I dreamt of my sister Charity, she was panting and refused to enter the house. She had a message for me and was asked to tell me that the only way to God is through Jesus Christ. I woke up to pray and the following weekend I went to church and gave my life to Christ.
     I found Grace</p></br>


<p>Read <strong>2 Chronicles 7:14</strong></p>
<p>Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek me my face and turn their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins and restore their land. </p>

<ul>
<li>Yes I should have lost my mind. </li>
<li>Yes I should have been in brokenness.</li> 
<li>Yes I have done the worst you could ever think of besides murder ofcoz.</li> 
<li>Yes I  should be drunk & out of my mind  but somewhere on the way I met a man by the name Jesus & He said He still loves me.</li> 
</ul>
<strong> Hallelujah To The Risen King!!!</strong></br></br>

<p>Jesus touched me and after his touch, I decided to make it right with God and men. I gave my life to Christ and became born again, beautiful thing ever. I made peace with everyone I thought am angry with or the opposite & I am so much at peace, I realized am more happy than ever , I wake up each & every day with a smile on my face. I feel so blessed, I have been made free, I have been forgiven. Thank you Lord. !</p></br> 
<p>I prayed for a way of  reaching out to  people who are seeking to make peace with their past , people who are heart broken, who feel stuck, lonely, empty, sad,  lost,living with fear, low self esteem, suffering from depression, anxiety , people who feel like God does not love them, people who suffered abuse or people who feel like they are not good enough... . Well I have a message for you <strong> GOD LOVES YOU.</strong> </p></br> 
<p>My goal is to convince you, to persuade you beyond the shadow of a doubt that God loves you with a love so profound it’s beyond your comprehension. 
Because when you believe that God loves you, it changes everything. God  Loves You Because He Created You.<strong> Psalm 139:13-14</strong>  says, “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”
You are not an accident. God himself created you, fearfully and wonderfully crafting every facet of your being. Every fiber of your DNA is the result of God’s master craftsmanship, and because he created you, God loves you. </p></br>


<p>God is God and He works all things, including your life, according to his purposes. Nothing can happen without God ordaining it.
<strong> Psalm 57:2 </strong> says, "I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me." This is key in understanding God's purpose for your life. God has numbered your days and will fulfill every purpose He has for you
Everyone needs God’s grace. Salvation is not a life made better. It is a life made brand new <strong> (2 Corinthians 5:17) </strong>. The Bible teaches a broken and burdened life is the requirement for entering God’s kingdom <strong>(Matthew 11:28)</strong>. After all, only sinners need a savior. Forgiving sins is what Jesus does best. It is an act of worship when we release our sins and let God forgive us.</p></br>

<p><strong>VERSES </strong></p>

<strong>Isaiah 43:18 - 19</strong>
<p>“Forget the former things;
    do not dwell on the past.
See, I am doing a new thing!
    Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?
I am making a way in the wilderness
    and streams in the wasteland.</p></br>

<strong> Philippians 3:13-14</strong> 
<p>Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,  I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.</p></br>

<strong> Corinthians 5:18-19</strong> New International Version (NIV)
<p>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</p></br>


<p><strong> Message</strong> :God has an amazing journey for us. Remember to Live. Love. Learn. along the way!</p>

<p>May the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.</p>

<strong>2 Corinthians 9:8</strong> And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.

<strong>John 8:12</strong> I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.

<strong>John 14:1-3</strong> Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.

<strong>James 1:5</strong> If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.

<strong>Mark 11:24</strong> Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

<strong>Psalm 37:4</strong> Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.

<strong>John 14:13</strong> And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.

<strong>Luke  11:9-13</strong> So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!

     <strong>Testimony</strong> is a form of praise and honor to Christ.
          
     We also use it as a way to encourage others. 
     Know every time when you’re going through trials and sufferings in life, that’s an opportunity to share a testimony of how God worked in your life and made you stronger.
     Testimony is not only the things that we say. The way we live our life is a testimony to unbelievers as well.</br>
     
    <strong> Verses</strong></br>
     
     <strong>Mark 5:19</strong> But Jesus said, “No, go home to your family, and tell them everything the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been.”</br>
     
<strong>Psalm 22:22</strong>  I will praise you to all my brothers; I will stand up before the congregation and testify of the wonderful things you have done.</br>
     
<strong> Psalm 66:16</strong> Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will tell you what he did for me.</br>
     
<strong>Psalm 35:28</strong> My tongue will declare your righteousness and praise you all day long.</br>
     
<strong>Daniel 4:2</strong> “I want you all to know about the miraculous signs and wonders the Most High God has performed for me.</br>
     
<strong>Luke 21:12-13</strong> But before all these things, people will arrest you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake, in order to give you an opportunity to testify.</br>
     
<strong>Philippians 1:12</strong> Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel.</br>
     
<strong>Philippians 1:12</strong> So I take pleasure in weaknesses, insults, catastrophes, persecutions, and in pressures, because of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</br></br>
